`ror4r` is an R wrapper for the [Research Organization Registry (ROR)](#https://ror.org) API. ROR is a registry of more than 100,000 research organisations across the globe. It holds data on location, aliases and type of organisation - plus much more.

Currently, the `ror4r` package lets you return a list of organisations (`get_org_list()`) or details for a specific organisation if you know its ID (`get_single_org()`) via the API. If you know IDs from other registries (eg, GRID, UKPRN), you can use `get_id_map()` to lookup other IDs for the organisation ROR has stored.

You may find the [API documentation](https://ror.readme.io/docs/rest-api), or the [reference site](http://shanj90.github.io/ror4r) helpful in using this wrapper. The [ROR API GitHub repo](https://github.com/ror-community/ror-api) may also be of use.

In addition to the API interactions, you can also use `read_data_dump()` to extract a dataframe of all the data from the system.

## Installation

You can install the development version of ror like so:

``` {r eval = F, echo = T} 
remotes::install_github("shanej90/ror4r")
```

## Example

The below example shows you how to return details for a specific organisation:

```{r example, eval = T, echo = T}
library(ror4r)

data <- get_single_org(id = "03yghzc09") #University of Exeter

data
```

## Future developments

At the moment, the package purely makes calls to the API and returns the data in an appropriate format. Future plans for the package will further process the data to meet specific goals. At the moment you'll need to do this outside of the package using your own understanding of the data. 

Feel free to fork if you'd like to have a go yourself.
